      "description": "I have loved computers since I was a child and grew up watching technological evolution unfold before my eyes, which was and still is prodigious. I began self-studying basic computer concepts at the age of 10, simply for the pleasure of learning, watching my logic and problem-solving abilities come into action in the hardware area. Programming started at the age of 14, and I developed a motto I like to share: \"Think & Execute\". I developed a very strong relationship with learning, not in terms of addiction, but in the healthy need to learn more and more to be able to execute tasks. Everything I know I learned in front of a computer, searching and learning, never trying to copy others' knowledge, but rather learning how to accomplish the task. I understand that we live in two worlds: the real and the digital. I started understanding the digital world from an early age and have always been a person who can easily adapt to the environment around me. Beyond software development, I offer computer repair services, server rack installation and maintenance, IT consulting, and live streaming system setup.",
