    "description": "Designed and implemented an end-to-end, high-throughput refurbishment and deployment workflow for resale PCs, combining network-boot provisioning (PXE) with an SFTP-backed artifact depot and custom Python/PowerShell CLI tooling. Built a standardized imaging pipeline that chainloads a minimal WinPE/maintenance environment via PXE, executes pre-flight hardware diagnostics (CPU/RAM/storage SMART and quick surface checks), captures asset/serial metadata, and enforces go/no-go gates before imaging. Orchestrated unattended OS installation and post-install provisioning (driver bundle staging, firmware/BIOS updates where applicable, policy/config baselines), followed by verification steps (health checks, telemetry collection, and burn-in spot tests) to ensure consistent outcomes with minimal technician intervention.\n\nEstablished a controlled SFTP release process for golden images, drivers, and scripts with checksum validation, and least-privilege access; Implemented resilient, idempotent CLI commands that support parallel batches, safe retries, and structured JSON logs for traceability. Added lightweight observability—per-station throughput, failure modes, and simple dashboards and daily reports to highlight bottlenecks and continuous-improvement opportunities.\n\n RMA handling (intake triage, status transitions, and labeling/traceability), reducing wait states and rework. Automated repetitive technician steps (checklists, image selection, driver matching, report generation), cutting average per-machine cycle time from ~15–20 minutes to ~3–5 minutes and enabling consistent multi-unit runs. Delivered practical training (shadowing, quick-ref guides) for technicians and interns to accelerate adoption, improve first-pass yield, and maintain standardized quality across the team.",
